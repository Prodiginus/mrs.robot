# This is a deprecated bot, it will barely work if it does at all

# Mrs. Robot - A Discord Bot

## Description

### This is a discord bot that is specifically designed for discord servers that need help managing a large collection of bots

### It is also heavily in development so please report any bugs to me on my discord server

---

## Once added to your server make sure that

### 1. The role `Mrs. Robot` is higher than the bot role (it may also have the bot role, just make sure that the specific `Mrs. Robot` role is above it)

### 2. This bot requires Admin permissions so make sure it has them
